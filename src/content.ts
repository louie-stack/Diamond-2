    q: "How does the 1% rule actually work?",
    a: "Every wallet gets one successful non-zero outbound transaction per rolling 24 hours, capped at 1% of its balance immediately before that transaction.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell as soon as I buy?",
    a: "Yes. Your first eligible outbound transaction is immediately available. The 24-hour cooldown begins only after you successfully make one.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does buying more reset my cooldown?",
    a: "No. Incoming $DIAMOND does not affect your cooldown.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I save up my 1% allowance?",
    a: "No. If your maximum is 1% and you only use 0.2%, you still can only sell 1% in the next period. Nothing accumulates.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the rule only apply to sells?",
    a: "No. Technically, it applies to outbound $DIAMOND movement from the wallet. That includes transfers as well as sells. This is to prevent manipulation of the mechanism.",
  },
  {
    q: "What about the DEX?",
    a: "The canonical $DIAMOND liquidity pair is unrestricted when sending tokens so normal buys can function. All holders remain subject to the normal outbound rule when sending $DIAMOND into the pool.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the team change the 1% or 24-hour rule later?",
    a: "No. They are fixed in the contract.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the team whitelist a wallet?",
    a: "No. There is no permanent holder-exemption system.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a honeypot?",
    a: "No. No hidden sell switch exists. Honeypots do not allow buyers to sell at all. $DIAMOND allows holders to sell a maximum of 1% of current holdings per day. Selling is deliberately restricted by the publicly disclosed 1%-per-24-hour mechanism, and that mechanism applies equally to all holders. The contract is verified. Read it.",
